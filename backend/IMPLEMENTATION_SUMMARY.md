# Implementation Summary: W_C Scoring & Atomic Multi-Slot Booking

## What Was Implemented

### 1. Robust Client Preference Match (W_C) Score System ✅

**Location:** `app/services/scoring_service.py`

A comprehensive scoring algorithm that ranks time slots based on client preferences with the following components:

#### Score Components:
- ✅ **Date Match (0-50 pts)**: Linear decay based on proximity to preferred start date
- ✅ **Time of Day Match (0-40 pts)**: Full points for slots in preferred time blocks
- ✅ **Avoid Time Penalty (-50 pts)**: Penalty for any overlap with avoid times
- ✅ **Weekend/Evening Bonus (0-10 pts)**: Bonus if client allows and slot matches

#### Features:
- ✅ Handles both single time blocks and time ranges
- ✅ Supports multi-slot bookings (consecutive slot combinations)
- ✅ Flags low scores (<0) for manual review
- ✅ Comprehensive error handling with safe fallbacks
- ✅ Detailed scoring breakdowns for transparency

#### Time Block Formats Supported:
```python
preferred_times = [
    "10:00",           # Single time point
    "10:00-12:00",     # Time range
    "14:00-17:00"      # Multiple ranges
]
```

### 2. Atomic Multi-Slot Booking Operations ✅

**Location:** `app/services/booking_service.py`

Ensures data integrity when booking multiple consecutive time slots for longer sessions.

#### Key Features:

##### a. Temporary Slot Locking (5-minute window)
```python
def _atomic_lock_slots(self, slot_ids: List[int]) -> bool:
    # Locks ALL slots together or fails
    # Prevents double-booking during transaction
```

##### b. Atomic Transaction with Verification
```python
# Step 1: Create Booking
booking = Booking(...)
db.add(booking)
db.flush()

# Step 2 & 3: Update ALL slots atomically
updated_count = db.query(TimeSlot).filter(
    TimeSlot.id.in_(slot_ids),
    TimeSlot.is_booked == False
).update({
    "is_booked": True,
    "booking_id": booking.id
})

# CRITICAL: Verify ALL updated
if updated_count != len(slot_ids):
    raise IntegrityError()  # Triggers ROLLBACK
```

##### c. Automatic Rollback on Failure
```python
@contextmanager
def atomic_booking(self):
    try:
        yield self.db
        self.db.commit()  # Only if successful
    except Exception as e:
        self.db.rollback()  # Undo all changes
        raise
```

#### Guarantees:
- ✅ All slots updated together or none updated
- ✅ No partial bookings ever created
- ✅ Automatic cleanup on conflicts
- ✅ Transaction-safe operations
- ✅ Handles concurrency conflicts gracefully

---

### 3. Enhanced Booking Service Methods ✅

#### New Methods Added:

1. **`_atomic_lock_slots()`** - Locks multiple slots atomically
2. **`_find_requested_time_slot_atomic()`** - Finds consecutive slots with validation
3. **`find_best_slots_with_scoring()`** - Integrates W_C scoring into booking flow

#### Enhanced Methods:

1. **`approve_booking_request()`** - Now uses atomic operations with:
   - Comprehensive logging at each step
   - Validation before and after updates
   - Proper rollback on any failure
   - Support for both single and multi-slot bookings

---

### 4. API Endpoint ✅

**New Endpoint:** `GET /booking-requests/{request_id}/scored-slots`

Returns time slots ranked by W_C score with full breakdown.

**Response Example:**
```json
{
  "request_id": 123,
  "scored_slots": [
    {
      "total_score": 95,
      "breakdown": {
        "date_match": 50,
        "time_of_day_match": 40,
        "avoid_time_penalty": 0,
        "weekend_evening_bonus": 5
      },
      "slot_id": 456,
      "slot_start": "2024-01-15T10:00:00Z",
      "requires_manual_review": false,
      "consecutive_slot_ids": [456, 457]
    }
  ],
  "message": "Found 5 time slots ranked by preference match",
  "scoring_info": {
    "max_date_score": 50,
    "max_time_score": 40,
    "max_bonus": 10,
    "avoid_penalty": -50,
    "best_score": 95
  }
}
```

### 5. Comprehensive Error Handling & Logging ✅

#### Log Levels Implemented:

**DEBUG Level:**
- Slot finding details
- Consecutive slot verification
- Preference matching checks

**INFO Level:**
```python
logger.info(f"Successfully locked {count} time slots atomically: {slot_ids}")
logger.info(f"Created Booking {booking.id} in transaction")
logger.info(f"Booking {booking.id} approved successfully")
```

**WARNING Level:**
```python
logger.warning(
    f"Low W_C score detected for BookingRequest {id}: Score={score}. "
    f"Manual review recommended. Breakdown: {breakdown}"
)
```

**ERROR Level:**
```python
logger.error(
    f"ATOMIC OPERATION FAILED: Expected to update {expected} slots, "
    f"but only updated {actual}. Rolling back transaction.",
    exc_info=True
)
```

#### Error Categories:

1. **Transaction Failures** - Full stack trace with slot details
2. **Low W_C Scores** - Flagged for manual review
3. **Concurrency Conflicts** - Detailed conflict information
4. **Scoring Errors** - Safe fallback with zero score

### 6. Test Suite ✅

**Location:** `backend/test_atomic_booking_scoring.py`

1. **W_C Scoring Tests**
   - Date proximity calculations
   - Time block matching
   - Avoid time penalties
   - Weekend/evening bonuses
   - Multi-slot combinations

2. **Atomic Booking Tests**
   - Single slot bookings
   - 90-minute bookings (2 slots)
   - 120-minute bookings (2 slots)
   - Successful transaction commits

3. **Concurrency Tests**
   - Two simultaneous booking attempts
   - First succeeds, second fails
   - No partial bookings created
   - Database integrity verification

**Run with:** `python test_atomic_booking_scoring.py`

## How It Works: End-to-End Flow

### Scenario: Client Requests 90-Minute Session

```
1. Client submits booking request
   ├─ Duration: 90 minutes
   ├─ Preferred times: ["10:00-12:00"]
   ├─ Avoid times: ["09:00-09:30"]
   └─ Date range: Jan 15-20

2. Trainer reviews request
   ├─ Calls: GET /booking-requests/123/scored-slots
   └─ Sees ranked options with W_C scores

3. System scores available slots
   ├─ Finds consecutive slot pairs (10-11, 11-12)
   ├─ Calculates W_C score for each combination
   ├─ Ranks by total score
   └─ Returns top 5 options

4. Trainer approves best slot
   ├─ Calls approve endpoint
   └─ System starts atomic transaction

5. Atomic booking process
   ├─ BEGIN TRANSACTION
   ├─ Lock slots [10-11, 11-12] temporarily
   ├─ Verify both still available
   ├─ Create Booking record
   ├─ Update slot 10-11: is_booked=True, booking_id=X
   ├─ Update slot 11-12: is_booked=True, booking_id=X
   ├─ Verify: expected=2, actual=2 ✓
   └─ COMMIT

6. Result: Booking confirmed with 2 slots booked atomically
```
